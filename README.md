Google badge holder stl for 3D printing (go/badgeholder)

Setting up this repository to keep track of the different stl made during my time in Google.

They are printed without support, with PLA, 40% density. Some have the Titan C holder. Some have a reference to the go/badgeholder, white label means there is no side marking.
